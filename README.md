# **Farmers Market (fMarket) Project**


# **Foreword**
FMarket is a Django project, created for the final exam of the SoftUni Python Web course. Since it is  created for educational purposes, it does not have full functionality required for a real application.

The project was developed using Django and Postgres DB, but switched to SQLite just before the final commit for convenient project run and testing with initial data of the functionalities by the exam masters. A Postres SQL dump file is included in the repo for those wishing to run the application with PostgresSQL (The data slightly differ from the included SQLite3 DB).

Everything in this project is created from scratch, including the design, the graphics, the HTML and the CSS, no templates or libraries were used.
# **Project Brief Description**
FMarket is an online marketplace platform project where farmers could offer their products to customers. The application targets users in EU countries only, sellers could select within the EU countries only and the currency is EUR.

The application is designed to function only as a virtual market stand, where farmers and customers meet. There is no ordering system and payment gateways, the farmers list their products, the customers contact the farmers by a mean they choose form the ones the farmer offers and arrange all details for the deal privately by phone, email or some messaging system.

The app has also a Help section and a Terms of Usage section, publicly visible.

# **Run the project**
